R-Clock is a clock for terminal interfaces, this will get the week day, month day, month, year, hours, minutes and opitionally seconds from your system. like a normal clock

## Small version
The program has a small version of the clock, if you wan't put the display in a small tmux or something like that. To use call the program with the first flag as "-s". This version will ignore the seconds, and will show the rest in display.
